## Description

  

  

  

_Mr. Rodgers Exercise is a program that takes a number from the user, counts from 1 to the number, places the count in an array while replacing any number that contain 1, 2, or 3 with a message._

  

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
|User enters a number, not trying replace things yet| 9 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |
|User enters a replaceable number | 1 | Beep |
|User enters a number that isn't immediately replaceable | 9 | Beep, Boop, Will you be my neighbor?, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |

## Technologies Used

  

  

  

_This site was built with HTML and CSS and implements JavaScript. Im still struggling with scope; it took a while for me to realize on the back end my input variable needed to be declared in the functions parameter. Once I got that, I was able to see things in my leap year & Pig Latin project that we're clearer, but still kind of puzzling; specifically how it was running through a variable and the input we declared through our function. Then rereading branching and array finally clicked that I could use the push method to a return array and have that define my lastNumber variable calling the function back inside jQuerey.

Another area i'm struggling is BDD. I have a hard time thinking about how something is going to be, especially when I don't know what everything does yet. I'm still trying to remember functions and methods and what syntax is needed and not. And thinking in math terms, my Roman Numerals project is untouched at this moment because yesterday i wasn't aware of certain methods I could use. So this morning, after freaking out a little and feeling like I was able to write out how I was feeling, I was able to reread things in a constructive way and implemented code in a way I could (mostly) understand. Uploaded to GitHub and described in README.md with Markdown_
